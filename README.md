**main:**  
`Camera: On/Off` Show current status of camera.  
`brake camera! (Button)` Click to turn off the camera once. (Some programs can turn on the camera again)  
`always brake camera (Switch)` Switch on to 
turn off the camera. (Doesn't allow the camera to be turned on again)

**setting:**  
`Logger (Switch)` Switch on to log.  
`Toaster (Switch)` Switch on to notify when camera is on.

## Realization
A (Windows) service called `FrameServer` controls whether the camera is turned on or off.  
**Emergency-Brakes** use `win32serviceutil` to check whether the camera is on and turn off the camera by stopping `FrameServer` service.
